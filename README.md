### Adaboost (Machine Learning)

This is a project for Machine Leaning 1 at FCUP. It was developed by:
- [Marisa Azevedo](https://github.com/marisaazevedo)
- [Margarida Vila Ch√£](https://github.com/margaridavc)
- [Ricardo Costa](https://github.com/ccosta-ricardo)

In this project we modified Adaboost in 2 different ways:
- The first one, we changed the weak leaner that is used. Usually decision trees with deph=1 are used, we decided to change each decision tree for a random forest with 40 decision trees, each with deph=2.
- For the second one we changed the way adaboost uses outliers.
